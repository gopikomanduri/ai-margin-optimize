# AI Margin Optimizer for F&O Large Traders

An AI-powered system that helps high-net-worth individuals reduce collateral over-pledging by 20-30% through advanced analysis of news sentiment, market data, and portfolio composition.

## Features

- **News Sentiment Analyzer**: Analyzes financial news from NewsAPI.org and Twitter to understand market sentiment
- **Macro Impact Engine**: Considers macroeconomic indicators from forex and commodity markets
- **Ensemble Predictor**: Uses XGBoost + LSTM to predict optimal margin requirements based on NSE historical data
- **Portfolio Integration**: Connects with broker APIs (ICICI/Kotak) to fetch real portfolio data
- **Margin Optimization**: Provides actionable insights to reduce margin requirements by 20-30%

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Python, Flask, XGBoost, HuggingFace Transformers
- **Data Sources**: NewsAPI.org, Twitter API, yfinance, Broker APIs (ICICI/Kotak)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap 5, Chart.js

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Required Python packages (install with `pip install -r requirements.txt`)
- API keys for:
  - NewsAPI.org
  - Twitter API
  - Broker APIs (ICICI/Kotak) - optional, will run in demo mode without them
  - Anthropic API (for advanced sentiment analysis) - optional, will use rule-based analysis without it
